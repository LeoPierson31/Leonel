    "Question 4. What is your p-value for hypothesis 3, and what does this indicate for your null hypothesis?\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, you cannot conclude at the 5% significance level that Michigan's mean AQI is greater than 10. This implies that Michigan would most likely not be affected by the new policy.\n",

    "Even with small sample sizes, the variation within the data is enough to allow you to make statistically significant conclusions. You identified at the 5% significance level that the Los Angeles mean AQI was stastitically different from the rest of California, and that New York does have a lower mean AQI than Ohio. However, you were unable to conclude at the 5% significance level that Michigan's mean AQI was greater than 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each test, you would present the null and alternative hypothesis, then describe your conclusion and the resulting p-value that drove that conclusion. As the setup of t-test's have a few key configurations that dictate how you interpret the result, you would specify the type of test you chose, whether that tail was one-tail or two-tailed, and how you performed the t-test from stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would you convey to external stakeholders?\n",
    "\n",
    "In answer to the research questions posed, you would convey the level of significance (5%) and your conclusion. Additionally, providing the sample statistics being compared in each case will likely provide important context for stakeholders to quickly understand the difference between your results.\n",
